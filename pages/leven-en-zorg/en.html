	<h2>Worry without worries</h2>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		Providing the best home care to the people who need it most, is the main focus of the Leven & Zorg care institution. And this was also their pain point. The administrative part associated with the client-intake took too much time, leaving less time and energy for the most important thing, namely good care! For care provision via the Dutch Long-term Care Act (WLZ) or Household Assistance (HbH), it is important that the mandatory administration takes as little time as possible. No complicated apps or binders with pen and paper; a good, but quick intake, so that the help that is needed can be offered immediately. 
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		Afterwards there is no need anymore to proces the administration and timesheets of the week hours at the office; a click of a button, signature of the client for approval on the tablet and done!

	<h2>INSPX: returning to the core of healthcare</h2>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		With INSPX Healthcare Intake, Leven & Zorg was able to make a significant improvement in efficiency. A handy workflow on a tablet, telephone or laptop ensures that the employees on site ask the right questions, cannot fill in wrong or empty answers and with the push of a button generate a digital report or file. Handy for the client, employee and health insurer..
	</tds-bold-text>	
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		With INSPX, healthcare employees can now:
		<ul>
			<li>taking care of intake of new clients with tablet/mobile or laptop</li>
			<li>complete the digital WLZ form according to Omaha on site</li>
			<li>complete the digital HbH form on site</li>
			<li>fill in timesheets digitally and sign digitally on site</li>
			<li>take a photo or make a situation sketch and add it to the form</li>
			<li>automatically send the completed forms to Nedap Ons or other systems</li>
			<li>providing the digital management dashboard with information for KPIs</li>
			<li>generate an audit trail for quality requirements and certification in healthcare</li>

	<h2>Files, reports and a dashboard</h2>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		Thanks to the smart integrations, care employees hardly have to do any administrative work afterwards. All relevant information is processed directly on location and forwarded to the back office systems. At Leven & Zorg, this is done through a link to Nedap Ons and the internal payroll system. The management of Leven & Zorg can also steer on KPIs, because all relevant data from INSPX is displayed on a dashboard. 
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		All possible variables, questions, answers and quantities are available in real time. Not only essential for management, but also for the frequent strict audits that healthcare institutions have to comply with.
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		All intake forms, including signature, are stored securely, but are available at all times. This comes in handy during audits and progress interviews with clients.
