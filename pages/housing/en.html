	<h2>All at once</h2>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		Effectively combining service call visits to their many housing projects proved to be a bit of a challenge for Housing Association X.
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		A tenant could report a broken window by phone, while the municipality could require an ad hoc checkup by mail. In the mean time regulations also required to do fire hydrant inspections in the same building but on another level.
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		In order to plan maintenance, servicing, logging and auditing for all their buildings in a smart way they had the need for multiple workflows, generated from different customer support channels (mail, phone, social media, etc.)
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		Funneling all these different forms of incidents and schedules and trying to wrap them all in one inspection seemed like the only logical thing to do.

	<h2>Workflows, auditing and the law</h2>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		Using the geolocation abilities of INSPX allowed service engineers to combine different chores and tasks per location.
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		Daily, monthly and yearly tasks could now be combined and generated per building or location.
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		By using datestamps, photographs and an advanced logging system the housing association is now able to work from a backlog and create an audit trail for its customers and other stakeholders.

		By creating an extensive log INSPX is able to export relevant information back to its CRM-system like service dates, proof-of-work etc.
	</tds-bold-text>
	<tds-bold-text class="line-height-l">
		This provides tenants and personnel with an overview of the work done.
